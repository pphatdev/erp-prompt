# Feature: Identity & Access Management (IAM)

## Overview
The IAM module is the core security layer of the ERP, handling multi-tenancy, authentication, and granular RBAC.

## 1. Governance & Multi-Tenancy
- **Database Isolation**: Strict separation using multi-database strategy.
- **Tenant Onboarding**: Automated provisioning of new tenant environments.
- **Custom Branding**: Tenant-specific themes, logos, and subdomains.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Role Management**: Define roles like Admin, Manager, and Finance at the tenant level.
- **Permission Mapping**: Module-feature-action granularity (e.g., `sales.invoice.delete`).
- **Inheritance**: Roles can inherit permissions from other roles.
- **Employee Self-Service Role**: Specialized role-mail login, restricted permissions, and ownership policy scoping.

## 3. Identity & Security
- **MFA/OTP**: Mandatory secondary verification for sensitive actions.
- **SSO Integration**: Support for SAML/OIDC.
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable record of all system interactions (Who, What, When).
