# **Recruitment Module: Applicant Flow Context**

*Human Resource Management (HRM) System*

---

## **1. Overview**

This document outlines the **end-to-end flow for applicants** in the **Recruitment Module** of the HRM system. It covers the journey from **sourcing to onboarding**, including key stages, stakeholders, automation opportunities, and metrics for success.

**Purpose**:

- Standardize the recruitment process.
- Improve efficiency and candidate experience.
- Provide a reference for HR, hiring managers, and developers.

---

## **2. Applicant Flow Stages**

### **Stage 1: Sourcing**

**Objective**: Attract qualified candidates for open positions.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Job Requisition Creation**
  - **Action**: Hiring manager submits a request via HRM system.
  - **Details**:
    - Job title, description, requirements.
    - Department, reporting line, salary range.
    - Urgency (e.g., "Fill within 30 days").
  - **Approval**: HR reviews and approves the requisition.
2. **Job Posting**
  - **Action**: HR posts the job to:
    - Company careers page (integrated with ATS).
    - External platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor).
    - Internal referrals (employee referral program).
  - **Automation**: ATS syncs postings across platforms.
3. **Candidate Sourcing**
  - **Active Sourcing**: Recruiters search for passive candidates (e.g., LinkedIn Recruiter).
  - **Passive Sourcing**: Candidates apply directly via job postings.

#### **Output**

- Pool of applicants in the ATS.

---

### **Stage 2: Application**

**Objective**: Collect and organize candidate information.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Application Submission**
  - Candidates apply via:
    - **Careers Portal**: Online form with resume/CV upload.
    - **Email**: Resumes sent to `careers@company.com`.
    - **Walk-ins**: For local hires (e.g., Cambodia-based roles).
  - **Data Captured**:
    - Personal details (name, contact info).
    - Resume/CV, cover letter.
    - Portfolio/links (for creative/technical roles).
2. **Automated Acknowledgment**
  - System sends a **confirmation email** to the applicant:
    - "Thank you for applying. We’ll review your application and contact you if there’s a match."
3. **Data Entry into ATS**
  - If applied via email/walk-in, HR manually uploads the resume to the ATS.
  - **Automation**: ATS parses resumes to extract key fields (skills, experience, education).

#### **Output**

- Candidate profile created in the ATS with a unique **Applicant ID**.
- Server auto-stamps a human-readable **Candidate Code** following the pattern `CAN-<YYYYMM>-<NNN>` (e.g. `CAN-202605-001`). The numeric component resets per-month and is derived from `applied_at`; withdrawn rows keep their numbers (audit invariant — see [`hrm/rules.md`](../rules.md) "Auto-generated `applications.candidate_code`"). Surfaced in the application list table, the kanban card subtitle, and details modals so recruiters can reference a candidate by code instead of UUID.

---

### **Stage 3: Screening**

**Objective**: Shortlist candidates for interviews.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Resume Screening**
  - **Action**: HR/Recruiter reviews applications based on:
    - Job requirements (skills, experience, education).
    - Keywords (e.g., "Python," "Project Management").
  - **Automation**:
    - ATS ranks candidates using **keyword matching** or **AI scoring**.
    - Flags mismatches (e.g., missing required skills).
2. **Initial Phone/Video Screen**
  - Recruiter conducts a **15-30 minute call** to:
    - Verify qualifications.
    - Assess communication skills and cultural fit.
    - Explain the role and company.
  - **Outcome**:
    - **Advance to Interview**: Schedule next round.
    - **Reject**: Send a polite rejection email (template from ATS).
3. **Shortlisting**
  - Recruiter creates a **shortlist** of candidates for the hiring manager.
  - **Collaboration**: Hiring manager reviews and approves the shortlist.

#### **Output**

- Shortlisted candidates move to the **Interview Stage**.

---

### **Stage 4: Interview Process**

**Objective**: Evaluate candidates for fit and competence.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Interview Scheduling**
  - Recruiter coordinates with:
    - Hiring manager.
    - Interview panel (e.g., team leads, peers).
    - Candidate (via email/calendar invite).
  - **Automation**:
    - ATS integrates with **Google Calendar/Outlook** to send invites.
    - Candidates receive **reminders** (24 hours before).
2. **Interview Types**
  - **Technical Round**: For role-specific skills (e.g., coding test for developers).
  - **Behavioral Round**: Soft skills, cultural fit (e.g., STAR method questions).
  - **Panel Interview**: Multiple interviewers (e.g., HR, manager, team member).
  - **Assignment/Case Study**: For roles requiring practical skills (e.g., marketing plan, coding challenge).
3. **Feedback Collection**
  - Interviewers submit feedback via **structured forms** in the ATS:
    - Rating (1-5 scale).
    - Strengths/weaknesses.
    - Recommendation (Hire/Reject/Hold).
  - **Automation**:
    - ATS aggregates feedback and calculates an **average score**.
    - Flags conflicts (e.g., one interviewer says "Hire," another says "Reject").
4. **Decision**
  - Hiring manager reviews feedback and makes a decision:
    - **Advance to Next Round**: Repeat interview process.
    - **Offer**: Move to Stage 5.
    - **Reject**: Send rejection email.

#### **Output**

- Final candidate(s) selected for an offer.

### **Stage 4.5: Hire → Employee Conversion**

**Objective**: Promote a hired application into a workforce-registry `Employee` record so the new hire appears in directory listings, payroll, leave, and downstream HRM features.

**Hard rule**: Transitioning the application to `hired` (Stage 4 Decision) **only changes status**. It does NOT create an Employee record. The link is an explicit, audit-bounded step performed by HR — never a side-effect of the kanban drag.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Single Conversion**
  - **Trigger**: Recruiter/HR clicks "Convert to Employee" on a `hired` application — surfaced on:
    - The kanban card (`/candidates`) hired-column conditional slot.
    - The application list (`/applications`) row kebab menu.
    - The application details modal footer.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /applications/{application}/convert-to-employee` → `RecruitmentService::convertToEmployee`.
  - **Behavior**:
    - Idempotent — repeat calls on the same application return the existing employee.
    - Dedupe-by-email — if an **active** `Employee` with the same email already exists, link to that one rather than cloning (response sets `linkedExisting: true` so the UI can toast accurately). Soft-deleted matches (terminated or post-revert) are ignored — a fresh row is created instead, so rehires get a new Employee record. The DB enforces this via a partial unique index on `email` (`deleted_at IS NULL` only).
    - Copies `department_id`, `position_id` from the vacancy, `expected_salary` → `base_salary`.
    - Stamps `applications.converted_at = now()`; creates the employee in `active` status.
    - **Auto-assigns `employee_id`** in the `<prefix>-<NNNN>` pattern via `RecruitmentService::generateNextEmployeeId()`. Zero-indexed — on a fresh tenant the first auto-issued ID is `TT-0000`, then `TT-0001`, `TT-0002`, … Sequence is global across the tenant. **Terminated employees keep their IDs** (so historical references resolve), but **reverted employees free their IDs** (see the Revert sub-process below) so the next convert can re-issue them. The pad width is a floor — past `TT-9999` the format widens to `TT-10000` automatically. Prefix and pad live as class constants (`EMPLOYEE_ID_PREFIX`, `EMPLOYEE_ID_PAD`).
  - **Permissions**: `hrm.recruitment.write` + `hrm.employee.write` (policy `ApplicationPolicy::convert`).

2. **Bulk Conversion**
  - **Trigger**: User selects multiple `hired`-and-unlinked rows on `/applications` and clicks "Convert N to Employee" in the bulk toolbar.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /applications/bulk-convert-to-employee` with `{ ids: string[] }` (1–200 UUIDs).
  - **Result shape**: `{ converted: int, alreadyLinked: string[], ineligible: string[], missing: string[], errors: Array<{id, message}> }`. The UI shows a partial-outcome toast (e.g. "3 converted · 1 already linked · 1 not hired") when the response isn't fully clean.

3. **Revert Conversion** (Undo window — 7 days)
  - **Trigger**: User clicks "Revert conversion" on a hired card whose `convertedAt` is within `RecruitmentService::REVERT_CONVERSION_WINDOW_DAYS` (= 7 days).
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /applications/{application}/revert-employee-conversion` → `RecruitmentService::revertEmployeeConversion`.
  - **Behavior**: Renames the linked `Employee`'s `employee_id` to `<original>-REV-<uniqid>` via an audited `update()`, then soft-deletes the row. The rename takes the original number out of the generator's `^<prefix>-(\d+)$` match set so the next convert can re-issue it (e.g. revert `TT-0003` → next convert returns `TT-0003`). The original ID is preserved inline in the renamed value for audit traceability. Nulls `applications.employee_id` and `applications.converted_at`.
  - **Refuses (422)** when: not `hired`, no linked employee, missing `converted_at`, or age > 7 days.
  - **Permissions**: `hrm.recruitment.write` + `hrm.employee.delete` (policy `ApplicationPolicy::revertConversion`). Stricter than `convert` because soft-deleting a workforce record can ripple into payroll/leave history.
  - **Outside the window**: recruiters must use the standard off-boarding path (`EmployeeService::terminateEmployee`) — the revert button hides automatically and the endpoint 422s.

#### **State invariants**

- `application.status = 'hired'` ⇏ `application.employee_id IS NOT NULL` — the two are decoupled by design. A hired application without an employee link is a normal, expected interim state.
- `application.converted_at IS NOT NULL` ⇔ `application.employee_id IS NOT NULL` — both fields move together (set on convert, cleared on revert).
- An `Employee` may have multiple historical applications pointing at it (re-hires) — `convertToEmployee` reuses the existing row when the email matches.

#### **Output**

- Application is linked to a workforce-registry Employee that is immediately visible in `GET /api/v1/employees` and ready for payroll, leave, and other downstream HRM modules.

---

### **Stage 5: Offer & Onboarding**

**Objective**: Secure the candidate and integrate them into the company.

#### **Sub-Processes**

1. **Offer Preparation**
  - HR drafts an **offer letter** including:
    - Position, salary, benefits.
    - Start date, probation period.
    - Contingencies (e.g., background check, reference checks).
  - **Approval**: Hiring manager and finance (for budget) approve the offer.
2. **Offer Communication**
  - HR sends the offer via:
    - **Email**: PDF attachment or eSignature link (e.g., DocuSign).
    - **Portal**: Candidate logs in to accept/reject.
  - **Automation**:
    - ATS tracks offer status (Pending/Accepted/Rejected).
    - Sends reminders if no response within **3-5 days**.
3. **Offer Negotiation (if applicable)**
  - Candidate may negotiate salary, benefits, or start date.
  - HR and hiring manager discuss and update the offer.
4. **Acceptance & Pre-Onboarding**
  - Candidate accepts the offer (e.g., signs digitally).
  - **Automation**:
    - ATS triggers **pre-onboarding tasks**:
      - Background check initiation.
      - Document collection (ID, certificates, bank details).
      - IT setup (laptop, email, system access).
  - **Welcome Email**: Sent with:
    - Onboarding schedule.
    - First-day instructions (e.g., dress code, reporting time).
    - Links to company policies/handbook.
5. **Onboarding**
  - **Day 1**:
    - HR introduces the employee to the team.
    - IT provides access to systems/tools.
    - Manager conducts a **role orientation**.
  - **First Week**:
    - Training sessions (company culture, tools, processes).
    - Meetings with key stakeholders.
  - **30/60/90-Day Check-ins**: Manager reviews progress and addresses concerns.

#### **Output**

- Employee is fully integrated into the workforce.
